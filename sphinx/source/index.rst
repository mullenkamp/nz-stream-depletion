nz-stream-depletion - New Zealand stream depletion tools
=========================================================

This python package contains a class and various functions for calculating stream depletion from pumping wells.
The stream depletion functions used in this package are derived from groundwater analytical solutions. Most of these were originally developed to support New Zealand regional councils in their water resource management. The stream depletion methods in this python package were transcribed from Excel VBA macros written by `Bruce Hunt <https://sites.google.com/site/brucehuntsgroundwaterwebsite/>`_. Matt Smith from `Environment Canterbury <https://www.ecan.govt.nz/>`_ created a complementary `excel spreadsheet <https://api.ecan.govt.nz/TrimPublicAPI/documents/download/3027564>`_ that has built upon Bruce Hunt's spreadsheet to be more user-friendly, and he also provided valuable input to the development of this package.

The GitHub repository is found `here <https://github.com/mullenkamp/nz-stream-depletion>`_.
